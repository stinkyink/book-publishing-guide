# What to Expect From This Guide

It used to be that getting a book to market was incredibly difficult. You
either went through a publisher (good luck), or printed it yourself (not
financially viable). This left many a budding author with an unattainable
dream, but no longer!

The internet has made both access to publishing companies, and self publishing, possible for the masses. Now, literally the only barrier to producing your own book is knowing how to
do it, which is where this guide comes in. 

You’ll find all the information you
need to help write, publish and market your very own publication, whether you
pursue the revolutionary eBook format, or go down the well trodden path of
physical publishing.

## In This Guide You Will Find Chapters On...

one particular piece of information you can jump straight to it. 

You’ll also find useful links and resources throughout this guide, and if there’s
something missing then let us know and we'll research and add it for you.

## Recommended Companies and Services

We've recommended companies wherever possible for resources
that we think are important to your publishing journey, with links to the
relevant parts of their websites. 

These companies were researched and
evaluated independently, and they are only recommended because we believe they
provide a brilliant service. We have no affiliation with any of these companies.
