# What to Expect From This Guide

It used to be that getting a book to market was incredibly difficult. You
either went through a publisher (good luck!), or printed it yourself (not
financially viable). This left many a budding author with an unattainable
dream, but no longer!

The internet has made self publishing possible, with the massive growth of
eBooks helping many authors realise their ultimate ambition of selling their
own book.

Now, literally the only barrier to producing your own book is knowing how to
do it, which is where this guide comes in. You’ll find all the information you
need to help write, publish and market your very own publication, whether you
pursue the revolutionary eBook format, or go down the well trodden path of
physical publishing.

## In this guide you will find chapters on...

* preparing your book for publishing
* publishing an eBook yourself
* publishing an eBook with an assisted publisher
* approaching and using a book Publisher
* print-on-demand services for small print runs
* Marketing your book once it’s produced

Each chapter is clearly broken down into segments, so if you’re looking for
one particular piece of information you can jump straight to it. You’ll find
useful links and resources abound throughout this guide, and if there’s
something missing then let us know so we can research and add it for you.

## Recommended companies and services

Throughout this guide you will find recommended companies for many resources
that we think are important to your publishing journey, with links to the
relevant parts of their websites. These companies were researched and
evaluated independently, and they are only recommended because we believe they
provide a brilliant service. We have no affiliation with any these companies,
with one exception.

The only company in this guide we do have an affiliation with is Lulu.com.
This affiliation occurred during production of this guide, when we contacted
them about details of their service and any possible savings for our readers.
We discovered there is a 20% saving for any new customers they receive through
an affiliate link, so we set up an account to get the code for you!

## So let’s get started

We’re not going to cover the basics of actually writing your book, such as
researching potential readers or authoritative figures in your genre. If you
need any tips on these areas you can [download a great little
guide](http://www.thebookdesigner.com/free-10-things-you-need-to-know-about-
self-publishing/) which goes into the necessary steps:

Additionally, if you’re looking to make contacts or attend events with like-
minded individuals, the website [Goodreads.com](http://goodreads.com) is a
great little resource. Linking you to readers and authors, and a very healthy
community, you can find a goldmine of information here.
