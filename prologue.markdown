# We wish you the best of luck

We really hope that some of the material we’ve provided here will assist you
in writing your book, and from the whole of the
[Stinkyink.com](http://www.stinkyinkshop.co.uk) team... good luck!

If there’s anything that you think we haven’t covered well enough let us know
and we’ll try to include some more information. Equally if you’ve got a
success story that we’ve been part of (even in a minor way) we’d really love
to hear from you.

In fact even if you just want to shamelessly plug your new book leave us a
comment below or send [@stinky_ink](https://twitter.com/#!/stinky_ink) a
tweet. We’ve got a few avid readers on our team who’d love to get their hands
on some new and exciting material and some new content on their Kindles.

I’ll leave you with a rather encouraging quote from the Nobel Prize winning
writer William Faulkner:

> At one time I thought the most important thing was talent. I think now that
> the young man or the young woman must possess or teach himself, training
> himself, in infinite patience, which is to try and to try until it comes
> right. He must train himself in ruthless intolerance--that is to throw away
> anything that is false no matter how much he might love that page or that
> paragraph. The most important thing is insight, that is to be--curiosity--to
> wonder, to mull, and to muse why it is that man does what he does, and if you
> have that, then I don't think the talent makes much difference, whether you've
> got it or not.
