# 3 - Producing your own physical book

There’s something wonderfully nostalgic about the thought of a traditional
book, and the hard copy market is not dead, far from it!

Before you look at producing your own physical book, you’ll need to have the
basics in place. If you’ve not already, read chapter 1 and check out how to
prepare your own book (link to chapter 1).


## <a name="chapter3_1">Chapter 3:1 - How to approach a publisher</a>

Publishers traditionally deal with the physical production of your books.

Publishers are notorious for being difficult to impress, as they deal with
thousands of enquiries every day and ultimately you’re just going to be
another unnamed author through their in-tray.

### Advantages of using a traditional publisher:

* Nothing beats the feeling of holding a book you’ve written
* Publishers have the knowledge and experience to give your book the greatest chance of success.

### Disadvantages Of Using a Full Publisher

* You’re going to have to learn to cope with rejection, a lot of rejection
* The time from being accepted to seeing your book in print can be massive (typically a year)
* Very low royalties compared to eBooks
* If they do an eBook version, your margins are also significantly lower
* Shorter shelf life
* Far more difficult/expensive to market.

If you want a quick glossary to explain all the important terms around book
publishing, there’s a [great little article
here](http://www.writersservices.com/res/ri_adv_royalties.htm) (apologies for
the website design, but the information is good in my opinion).

Unless you’re an established, successful author, this route is going to be
very difficult. That doesn’t mean it’s not worth doing though, so we’ve listed
everything you need below to give you the best chance of success!

### Step 1 - You’re going to need an agent

If you want to maximise your chances of being accepted by a publisher, the
first step is to find an agent. Not many people realise but many of the major
publishers don’t even accept entries submitted without an agent, which really
hits home how important this step is.

Your agent can be your knowledge base for your book to feed off, assisting in
anything from publishing best practices, to your rights if a book ever goes to
film or foreign markets.

####Tips on finding an agent

Writing groups are a great way to start finding connections in an area.
There’s a great resource on Twitter for this -
[@WritersGroups](https://twitter.com/#!/WritersGroups) - which is a good way
to get in touch with like-minded people who can help.

The internet is a fantastic resource, with access to countless social websites
and of course Google, for finding top recommended and reviewed agents.

[Bloomsbury actually recommend a company](http://www.writersandartists.co.uk/)
for pursuing your project with, and they can help link you up with agents,
though it does come at a cost of £119.

####What kind of agent - big or small?

Agencies can come in two forms, your massive firms with senior partners and
agents that deal with thousands of clients, to the single agents that will
deal with a few dozen authors personally.

Whichever you prefer, try and deal with an agent/agency that specialises in
your topic. For example, if you’re the proud author of the next big science
fiction novel, try and find agents with previous experience in science fiction
books. They’ll have the market contacts and knowledge to give you the best
possible chance of success.

An example of a specialist agency is the [Andrew Lownie Literary
Agency](http://www.andrewlownie.co.uk/how_to_submit). You’ll see whenever they
talk about themselves they mention specialising in non-fiction, particularly
in history and biographies. Contacting them with the next best fantasy
adventure probably won’t yield a result.

####Beware scam agents

Agents for authors is a market heavily at risk of fraud, and you need to be
very careful when approaching anyone. The major clue will be in their pricing.

It is highly unusual for an agent to charge any form of fees other than their
share of sales they make on your behalf. Be wary of upfront costs or agent
fees that are not directly linked to the sale of your book.

####What to send a potential agent

Once you’re ready to contact an agent, you need to prepare a few things.
Double check this with the specific agent in question as they may request
exactly what they want. Otherwise a good standard to adhere to is:

* A covering letter, with any author-related qualifications and what your intent for the book is
* The first three chapters
* If you’re applying by letter, they also expect a self-addressed stamped envelope so they can send you a response. 

### Step 2: Taking the plunge - How to approach a publisher

Before approaching publishers you need to understand their role. Their job is
to limit the thousands of applications they receive to the worthy few. This
simple sentence explains the role of a publisher perfectly:

> The supply of hopeful authors is infinite, the supply of publishing
> resources is finite.

Due to this, you need to make the most of your own chance to impress, and it’s
up to you and your agent to get this proposal together.

There’s an amazing guide from the incredibly experienced publishing editor,
[Michael Hyatt](http://michaelhyatt.com/five-publishing-hurdles-and-how-to-
clear-them.html), which walks you through the stages a publishing house goes
through when moving a potential book from proposal onto the shelves. I highly
recommend that you read it.

Whilst I won’t take all of the points from that great guide, there are some
key pointers to draw from it. Please note these are all Michael Hyatt’s
comments, not ours, but we literally could not phrase this section any better
than he already has. Thanks Michael:

No matter what stage you’re at, always remember to be polite. Publishers are
renowned for being a close knit circle of power players, if you get a bad
reputation or review from one, you’ll likely find many other doors suddenly
close.

### Step 3: What to expect if successful

####Publishing date

Typically it takes over a year for a book to be published once it has been
accepted, and that is after months of waiting to hear whether your script has
met with the publisher’s approval.

####Costs and revenue

There shouldn’t be any direct costs involved with producing your book, as your
publisher takes responsibility for everything from cover design to marketing.
Obviously you’ll still have input and influence in the matter, but the money
is with the publishers.

Once your book is published, your royalties will hopefully start to roll in.
Typically you’re looking at around 15% of the net revenue of your book coming
back to your wallet.

####eBook revenue

Unless they really have their head in the sand, publishers will also produce
an eBook version for you. However, and this is where the real complaint for
publishers comes in, you make absolute pittance compared to if you publish
your work. Instead of the typical 56%-70% returns, you’ll be getting roughly a
15% return per eBook sale, for the life of the book.

Beware of higher quoted returns on “net” revenue. For example, a 25% return on
net revenue from an Amazon Kindle sale equates to 14.9% after Amazon take
their 30% share and the agent takes an assumed 15% share.

####Publishing rights

The vast majority of publishing contracts will sign away the rights for the
life of the book. Any royalty rate agreed will typically remain for that
single book, which is why you need to be so careful with initial negotiations.

####Marketing demands

Again this will be down to the publisher and the route to market your book
takes. Whether it’s an interview for a book review blog, or a signing at
certain book stores, there will be expectations of you to get the most out of
your book (less so if this is your first book and you’re an unknown name).

## <a name="chapter3_2">Chapter 3:2 - How to publish your own book</a>

Regardless of how you choose to pursue your own book, you’ll need to have the
basics in place. If you’ve not already done so, pop to chapter 1 and check out
how to prepare your own book (link to chapter 1).

Printing used to be prohibitively expensive for most authors, but as
technology improves, costs get lower. Print-on-demand services have grown
significantly and it’s now possible to link sales from your website to a
company that prints as and when needed.

### Advantages of printing yourself

* Print-on-demand removes any need to carry stocks of your book
* There’s something innately satisfying about taking your beloved book from idea to a physical, treasured item
* Works perfectly in combination with an eBook, acting as a limited edition hard copy.

### Disadvantages of printing yourself

* Difficult to distribute hard copies yourself
* If you want to distribute large numbers of books, the upfront cost is significant
* More expensive than eBooks and/or publishing deals.

Ultimately, there is very little money in print-on-demand services if you’re
using it as the only publication route. You can’t qualify for the discounts
offered by large print runs, and you won’t have enough clout to get your books
pushed into your local Waterstones to drive sales that way.

In fact you’ll be largely printing reactively to requests. Thus, narrowing
your sights to just publishing this way puts you in a difficult position.

####So why bother with print-on-demand services?

Low volume printing is absolutely perfect to complement another book-selling
medium, such as eBooks. There are few better ways to build intrigue and a
relationship with your readers and fans than offering limited edition hard
copy versions, complete with author signature and personalised message. This
is where low-volume print versions really come into their own.

Furthermore, if you’re operating in a niche environment, or have perceived
expertise in an educational area, a limited print run of a book means you can
charge a higher cost and actually profit from smaller numbers. You commonly
see this from professionals in fields such as psychology, where they can
publish experience and research in limited volumes.

### So what are your options for low volume, hard copy printing?

####Self printing / binding

Making your own hard copy is surprisingly cheap in monetary terms, the largest
component of the costs being the postage. The true cost however is in time,
creating a book by hand requires [patience and
skill](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy3ahNHje9I&feature=related), as well as
some simple tools.

Most of the bookbinding tools you’ll need are commonly found in craft stores
but you may have to build your own binding jig as these are slightly harder to
come by. However the [process of making
one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1nIDz4YgM4) isn’t particularly difficult,
and since it’s simply a wooden frame it’s not expensive either.

We’ve gathered a couple of
[guides](http://www.persistenceunlimited.com/2006/03/fun-and-easy-how-to-
guide-to-binding-your-own-paperback-books-at-homefast/) and
[videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBSUHbyf7Ss) offering you advice on
how to go about the physical steps of printing and binding your own book.

####Print-on-demand

<img src="/img/printondemand.jpg" class="align-center" />

If the idea of getting involved in the glue and paper side of your book really
doesn’t appeal to you then your best bet is a print-on-demand service. The
name is fairly self explanatory, you make no commitment to a minimum print run
or upfront cost, and simply print a single copy whenever a book is purchased
or requested.

This whole process can be automated over the internet allowing your book to be
on sale through major retailers online before the first copy is printed.

This system is very cost effective, since books are only printed when they’re
sold, so there’s no large sum of money tied up in stocks. What’s more, the
print-on-demand services we’ve listed below understand their markets and as
such provide affordable rates on their services that won’t break the bank.
